Won Best Use of SmartThings

We believe that voice command is the future. Therefore, we have created Jarvis, a chrome extension that allows you to control basically everything through voice. 
To start, we have hardcoded several commands that most people would find useful, such as opening any website (open facebook), playing a song (youtube all of me), and opening any drive documents (document psych).
On top of that, we allow users to create their own commands that link to a specific url, such as a command to compose a new email (create new email), or command to take you to your bank website (create show me the money).
Finally, for the programmers out there, we have included a script field that would allow you to map a command to any code you want to execute. The possibilities are endless. WIth more and more application having Restful API, you can do things from launching a drone to conducting a remote surgery. 
As an example, we can post on a friendâ€™s wall like this. Or we can do something more useful such as turn this light on/off with whatever commands we like. 
We are excited to see what commands you will create because with Jarvis, anyone can be Ironman.
